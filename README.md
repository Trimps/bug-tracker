Choose an issue template you think fits what you are trying to post the most, then press the Get started button.

Write a concise title containing keywords relevant to your issue. "I found a bug" is a bad title. "GA is not firing jobs when in Mapology" is a good title.

The "Write" box may be pre-filled with some text. This text is intended to help guide you in posting information we think may be relevant. Delete the text that is already there as you see fit, and replace it with the information that is asked about.

Finally, hit Submit new issue.

Thank you very much for your bug reports and suggestions! You help make Trimps better :)
