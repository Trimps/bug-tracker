# Unsolicited Idea Submission Policy
GreenSatellite and their employees and contractors do not accept, review or consider any unsolicited ideas, works, materials, proposals, suggestions, artwork, content or the like, including for advertising campaigns, promotions, products, services, technologies, product enhancements, processes, marketing strategies, product names, content or creative materials (all of the foregoing “submissions”). Please do not send or provide any submissions in any form to GreenSatellite or any of its employees or contractors.

The purpose of this policy is to avoid potential misunderstandings or disputes when GreenSatellite’s products, services, technologies, advertising, promotions, marketing strategies or content might seem similar to submissions provided to GreenSatellite. If, despite our request that you not send us your submissions, you still submit them, then regardless of what your correspondence says, the following terms will apply to your submissions.

## Terms of Idea Submission
You agree that: 
1. your submissions and their contents along with related intellectual property rights will automatically become the property of GreenSatellite, without any compensation to you; 
2. GreenSatellite may use or redistribute the submissions and their contents for any purpose and in any way on an unrestricted basis; 
3. there is no obligation for GreenSatellite to review the submissions; and 
4. there is no obligation to keep any submissions confidential.

GreenSatellite does, however, welcome your feedback regarding many areas of GreenSatellite’s existing business. If you want to send us feedback, we request that you use the forms located [on GitHub](https://github.com/Trimps/bug-tracker/issues/new/choose). Please provide only specific feedback on GreenSatellite’s existing products, services and marketing strategies using those forms; and do not send or provide any submissions other than using those forms.
